 *
 * Implementations of pathological sorting algorithms.
 *
 * These algorithms are very slow (worse than O(N^2) average case) and should
 * never be used to solve real problems.
 *
 * Futhermore, some algorithms are annotated using the mark() and watch()
 * functions from SortArray. These functions add colors to the illustratation
 * and thereby makes the algorithm's visualization easier to explain.
