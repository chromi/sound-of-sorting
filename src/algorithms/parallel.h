 *
 * Implementations of sorting algorithms intended for parallel processors.
 *
 * The machine model here is not a parallel processor, so the performance of
 * these algorithms is not representative.
 *
 * Futhermore, some algorithms are annotated using the mark() and watch()
 * functions from SortArray. These functions add colors to the illustratation
 * and thereby makes the algorithm's visualization easier to explain.
