 *
 * Implementations of selection sorting algorithms.
 *
 * Note that these implementations may not be as good/fast as possible. Some
 * are modified so that the visualization is more instructive.
 *
 * Futhermore, some algorithms are annotated using the mark() and watch()
 * functions from SortArray. These functions add colors to the illustratation
 * and thereby makes the algorithm's visualization easier to explain.
